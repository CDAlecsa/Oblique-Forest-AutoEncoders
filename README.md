# Oblique-Forest-AutoEncoder

###### This repository contains the codes for the article *OF-AE: Oblique Forest AutoEncoders*, where we have implemented an unsupervised forest-type autoencoder consisting of oblique trees (HHCART and RandCART).
###### As noted in the paper, the implementation of the oblique trees is based upon *https://github.com/valevalerio/Ensemble_Of_Oblique_Decision_Trees* and *https://github.com/hengzhe-zhang/scikit-obliquetree*, respectively. 
###### For the setup, one must specify the train and test paths for the custom datasets (for usage, see the *misc/datasets.py*). Furthermore, inside the codes one must put the absolute path for the command *sys.path.insert* in order to correctly load up the modules.
